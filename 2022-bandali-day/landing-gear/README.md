Unlike the other case studies in this collection, for the landing gear
case study there are multiples models in each language.  This is
because the AsmetaL model for the case study by Arcaini et al. was
done over a series of gradual refinements, were incrementally more
details were added at each step, and the inidividual files were all
preserved/presented.  We decided to do the same for our landing gear
models as well.
